# Language Style Guide

## Japanese (Source/Target)
* **Default**: Use `Desu/Masu` (polite) form unless specified otherwise.
* **Business**: Use `Keigo` (Sonkeigo/Kenjougo) appropriately based on relationship.
* Avoid direct "No". Use softer refusals ("It is difficult", "We will consider").

## Korean (Source/Target)
* **Default**: Use `Haeyo-che` (polite informal) or `Hapsyo-che` (formal).
* In Strict Business: Always use `Hapsyo-che` (~nida).

## English (Target)
* Be direct but polite.
* Convert passive/vague subjects to active "I" or "We" where appropriate for clarity.
* Example: "It is considered..." -> "We act/think..."

## General Translation Policy
* **Ambiguity**: If the source is intentionally ambiguous (e.g. to save face), preserve the ambiguity in translation BUT flag it for "Explanation Service".
* **Subject**: If subject is omitted (common in JA/KO), infer it from context.
